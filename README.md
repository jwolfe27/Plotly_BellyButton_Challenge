## Purpose of Assignment
For this assignment, I built a user friendly dashboard which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  This interactive dashboard allows the user to explore the results which are organized by "Subject ID".  The dataset reveals that a handful of species, referred to as OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) are present in or on more than 70% of people.  

Here is a link to my dashboard: https://jwolfe27.github.io/Plotly_BellyButton_Challenge/

## The Process
1. Use D3 Library to read the samples.json.  Users can select a Subject ID to see the info relevant to that participant

2. Create a Bar Chart to display the TOP 10 species (OTUs) found for that specific individual

3. Create a Bubble Chart to display bacterial cultures per sample

4. Create a Gauge to display the "Belly Button Washing Frequency - Scrubs Per Week" for the selected Subject ID (Participant)
